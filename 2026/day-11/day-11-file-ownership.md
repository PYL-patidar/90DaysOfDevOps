## Day 11 Challenege

- Files and directories Created
- Ownershop changes

# Commands used :
- Check group and owners : ls -l
- change ownership of user : sudo chown user: <file_name>
- change ownership of group : sudo chown :group <file_name>
- for both : sudo chown user:group <file_name>
- change recursively ownership : sudo chown -R user:group <dir_name>
- varify command : ls -lR <dir_name>


## I learned :
it's clear to me about difference between chown and chgrp
