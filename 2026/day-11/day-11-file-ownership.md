## Day 11 Challenege

- Files and directories Created
- Ownershop changes

# Commands Used for Ownership Management 
- Check file owner and group <br>
  Command : `ls -l`

- Change ownership of a user <br>
  Command : `sudo chown <user> <file_name>`
  
- Change ownership of a group <br>
 Co: sudo chown :group <file_name>
- for both : sudo chown user:group <file_name>
- change recursively ownership : sudo chown -R user:group <dir_name>
- varify command : ls -lR <dir_name>
